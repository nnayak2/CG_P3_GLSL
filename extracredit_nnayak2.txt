1. support arbitrarily sized images (and interface windows):

read window.txt file for window parameters.
p x y
where p is pixel width and height


2. support arbitrary viewing setups:

read view.txt file for camera parameters.
Format as follows:
e x y z
l x y z
u x y z
n x
f x
where order is eye, look, up, near and far plane.


3. support multiple lights at arbitrary locations: (max 8 lights, GL limitation.)

Read lights.txt file for lights. Each light should have following 5 parameters in order given below.
p x y z
a r g b
d r g b
s r g b
The values correspond to position, ambient, diffuse, specular.


4. up to 15% to support multiple image formats:

You can load multiple images per run, and all image formats supported by SOIL lib can be added.
BMP works, PNG works, JPG - not working correctly in all jpg images.
I spoke with Dr Watson, and he said he could give me 10% and not 15% for this 4th point of extra credit.
